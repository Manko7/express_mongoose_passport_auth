# express_mongoose__passport_auth
Out of the box boilerplate for authentication using Expressjs, MongoDB and Passportjs

You need to have node.js and MongoDB installed.

run npm install and go

It includes:
- basic authentication (login, register, logout)
- basic express config
- basic passport setup
- templating engine is set to ejs
- User Model containing username and password (which is split into salt and hash because of encryption by passportjs)

Just go and adapt more to it
